When it healed, and Jem\u2019s fears of never being able to play football were \nassuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was \nsomewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand \nwas at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn\u2019t have \ncared less, so long as he could pass and punt.\nWhen enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we \nsometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells \nstarted it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before \nthat. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea \nof making Boo Radley come out.\nI said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew \nJackson.

Our father said we were both right.\nBeing Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that \nwe had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had \nwas Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was \nexceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the \npersecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more \nliberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way \nacross the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up \nthe Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley\u2019s strictures on the use of many words \nin buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit \nhe was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory \nof God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten \nhis teacher\u2019s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and \nwith their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some \nforty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find \na wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to \nan impressive age and died rich.\nIt was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon\u2019s homestead, \nFinch\u2019s Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: \nmodest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless \nproduced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles \nof clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.\nSimon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North \nand the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet \nthe tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth \ncentury, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his \nyounger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the \nFinch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most \nof his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.\nWhen my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his \npractice.

I once asked Atticus if it ever had any; \nAtticus said yes, but before I was born.\nAccording to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his \nteens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an \nenormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and \nthey formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but \nenough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they \nhung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and \nwent to the picture show; they attended dances at the county\u2019s riverside gambling \nhell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole \nwhiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy \nwas in with the wrong crowd.\nOne night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square \nin a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycomb\u2019s ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, \nand locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to \nbe done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he \nwas bound and determined they wouldn\u2019t get away with it, so the boys came \nbefore the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, \nassault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and \nhearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge; \nMr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard \nthem. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where \nboys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and \ndecent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. \nIf the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no \nfurther trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radley\u2019s word was his bond, the judge was \nglad to do so.\nThe other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary \neducation to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through \nengineering school at Auburn.

According to Miss \nStephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The \nMaycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. \nRadley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parent\u2019s leg, pulled them out, \nwiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.\nMrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but \nwhen the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the \nTribune. He was thirty-three years old then.\nMiss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, \nwhen it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo.

What Jem called \nthe Dewey Decimal System was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had \nno chance to compare it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around \nme: Atticus and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everything\u2014at \nleast, what one didn\u2019t know the other did. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t help noticing \nthat my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected each time \nwithout opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to \nthe development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on a half-Decimal half-\nDuncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group, but Jem was a \npoor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from \ngetting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from Time \nmagazine and reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched \nsluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not \nhelp receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of \nwhat I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom \nwas exactly what the state had in mind for me.\nAs the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to \nstay until three o\u2019clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping \nuntil I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, \nsomething caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a \nlong look around, and went back.\nTwo live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the \nside-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my \nattention.\nSome tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in \nthe afternoon sun.

We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley. \nWhat Mr. Radley did might seem peculiar to us, but it did not seem peculiar to \nhim. Furthermore, had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate \nwith another being was by the front door instead of a side window?

Atticus \nsaid someone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me \nwhen I tried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered \nanybody who ever won one, and Atticus said no.\nOur biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldn\u2019t \nrun, on a chain with an aluminum knife.\n\u201cYou reckon it\u2019s white gold, Jem?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ll show it to Atticus.\u201d\nAtticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were \nnew. \u201cDid you swap with somebody at school?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, no sir!\u201d Jem pulled out his grandfather\u2019s watch that Atticus let him carry \nonce a week if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem \nwalked on eggs. \u201cAtticus, if it\u2019s all right with you, I\u2019d rather have this one instead. \nMaybe I can fix it.\u201d\nWhen the new wore off his grandfather\u2019s watch, and carrying it became a day\u2019s \nburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every \nfive minutes.\nHe did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch \nwould not run. \u201cOh-h,\u201d he sighed, \u201cit\u2019ll never go.

No,\u201d my father mused, \n\u201cyou had the right answer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is \na stage all children go through, and it dies with time when they learn they\u2019re not \nattracting attention with it. Hotheadedness isn\u2019t. Scout\u2019s got to learn to keep her \nhead and learn soon, with what\u2019s in store for her these next few months. She\u2019s \ncoming along, though. Jem\u2019s getting older and she follows his example a good bit \nnow. All she needs is assistance sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cAtticus, you\u2019ve never laid a hand on her.\u201d\n\u201cI admit that.

That\u2019s what makes the difference. \nWhat bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty \nsoon.

When Jem and I asked him why he was so \nold, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and \nmanliness. He was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and \nthere was nothing Jem or I could say about him when our classmates said, \u201cMy \nfather\u2014\u201d\nJem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when \nJem wanted to tackle him Atticus would say, \u201cI\u2019m too old for that, son.\u201d\nOur father didn\u2019t do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus \ndid not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, \nwork in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of \nanyone.\nBesides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left \neyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something \nwell, he turned his head and looked from his right eye.\nHe did not do the things our schoolmates\u2019 fathers did: he never went hunting, he \ndid not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read.\nWith these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we \nwished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom \nRobinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs \nwhen I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout \nFinch wouldn\u2019t fight any more, her daddy wouldn\u2019t let her. This was not entirely \ncorrect: I wouldn\u2019t fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I \nwould fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail.

She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the \nkitchen, and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in \nbeing a girl.\nBut summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from \nhim. The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he \nwould have to stay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His \nfather was a lawyer like Atticus, only much younger. Dill\u2019s new father had a \npleasant face, which made me glad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill \nconcluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry, he would come \nget me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together, so please write.\nThe fact that I had a permanent fianc\u00e9 was little compensation for his absence: I \nhad never thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, \nDill\u2019s eyes alive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer \nwas the swiftness with which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not \nlooking, the longings we sometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was \nroutine; without him, life was unbearable. I stayed miserable for two days.\nAs if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session \nand Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few \nbarnacles off the ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread \nlines in the cities grew longer, people in the country grew poorer.

I was bursting with questions, but decided I \nwould wait and let Calpurnia answer them.\n\u201cWe were \u2018specially glad to have you all here,\u201d said Reverend Sykes. \u201cThis \nchurch has no better friend than your daddy.\u201d\nMy curiosity burst: \u201cWhy were you all takin\u2018 up collection for Tom Robinson\u2019s \nwife?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear why?\u201d asked Reverend Sykes. \u201cHelen\u2019s got three little\u2019uns and \nshe can\u2019t go out to work\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t she take \u2018em with her, Reverend?\u201d I asked. It was customary for field \nNegroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while \ntheir parents worked\u2014usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of \ncotton. Those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers\u2019 backs, \nor resided in extra cotton bags.\nReverend Sykes hesitated. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helen\u2019s \nfinding it hard to get work these days\u2026 when it\u2019s picking time, I think Mr. Link \nDeas\u2019ll take her.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1869, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61d21fe4-013a-495b-b19c-2e26d2ea14e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "61d21fe4-013a-495b-b19c-2e26d2ea14e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "137ff16f-8d07-421a-b11a-3e29bd020dba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "hash": "4a13517f8863af42cb8638696a1f0106ffa7ccac0b960cb927e0797a14b99210", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u201cWhy not, Reverend?\u201d\nBefore he could answer, I felt Calpurnia\u2019s hand on my shoulder.

I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose \nprotective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her \nwaist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra\u2019s was once \nan hour-glass figure.

Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose \nher coming to live with us was in that category.\nMaycomb welcomed her.

When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not \nbe found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She was never bored, and \ngiven the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would \narrange, advise, caution, and warn.\nShe never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal \ngroups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than \nannoyed him: \u201cAunty better watch how she talks\u2014scratch most folks in \nMaycomb and they\u2019re kin to us.\u201d\nAunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather\u2019s suicide,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2325, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d767e4b-ca23-425b-97bb-f74fb85e0e07": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d767e4b-ca23-425b-97bb-f74fb85e0e07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00eb49ad-cbc6-4a9b-aed9-5a17bf115dec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "hash": "35feeb8d284947b3f6a017c4dbe4d221cea2830ca91a4945115f68d3ab4f721a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family.

But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not \nbeen for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history \noperated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. \nSinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers \nalike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory \nor the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when \nGovernor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created \ncounty\u2019s domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact \ncenter and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield\u2019s \nguests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, \nand showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not \nSinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat \nin the middle of Winston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest.

To begin with, this \ncase should never have come to trial. This case is as simple as black and white.\n\u201cThe state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the \ncrime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place.

She has \ncommitted no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our \nsociety, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as \nunfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot \npity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because \nher desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in \nbreaking it. She persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us \nhave known at one time or another. She did something every child has done\u2014she \ntried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no \nchild hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim\u2014of necessity she \nmust put him away from her\u2014he must be removed from her presence, from this \nworld. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.\n\u201cWhat was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must \nput Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what \nshe did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.\n\u201cShe was white, and she tempted a Negro.

For one thing, Miss Maudie can\u2019t serve on a jury because she\u2019s a woman\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou mean women in Alabama can\u2019t\u2014?\u201d I was indignant.\n\u201cI do. I guess it\u2019s to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom\u2019s. \nBesides,\u201d Atticus grinned, \u201cI doubt if we\u2019d ever get a complete case tried\u2014the \nladies\u2019d be interrupting to ask questions.\u201d\nJem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old \nMrs. Dubose in her wheelchair\u2014\u201cStop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask \nthis man something.\u201d Perhaps our forefathers were wise.\nAtticus was saying, \u201cWith people like us\u2014that\u2019s our share of the bill. We \ngenerally get the juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens aren\u2019t interested, \nin the first place. In the second place, they\u2019re afraid. Then, they\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAfraid, why?\u201d asked Jem.\n\u201cWell, what if\u2014say, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to \naward, say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link \nwouldn\u2019t like the thought of losing either lady\u2019s business at his store, would he? \nSo he tells Judge Taylor that he can\u2019t serve on the jury because he doesn\u2019t have \nanybody to keep store for him while he\u2019s gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him. \nSometimes he excuses him wrathfully.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d make him think either one of \u2018em\u2019d stop trading with him?\u201d I asked.\nJem said, \u201cMiss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldn\u2019t. But a jury\u2019s vote\u2019s secret, \nAtticus.\u201d\nOur father chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve many more miles to go, son. A jury\u2019s vote\u2019s \nsupposed to be secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and \ndeclare himself about something. Men don\u2019t like to do that.

From the kitchen, I heard Mrs. Grace Merriweather giving a \nreport in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the Mrunas, it sounded like to me. \nThey put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they \nhad no sense of family\u2014I knew that\u2019d distress Aunty\u2014they subjected children to \nterrible ordeals when they were thirteen; they were crawling with yaws and \nearworms, they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot \nand then got drunk on it.\nImmediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.\nI didn\u2019t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. Aunt Alexandra told \nme to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that I attend the business \npart of the meeting, she said it\u2019d bore me.

The last note would \nlinger as long as there was air to sustain it.

She \nhad a fresh permanent wave, and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets. She \nwas the second most devout lady in Maycomb. She had a curious habit of \nprefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound.\n\u201cS-s-s Grace,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s just like I was telling Brother Hutson the other day. \n\u2018S-s-s Brother Hutson,\u2019 I said, \u2018looks like we\u2019re fighting a losing battle, a losing \nbattle.\u2019 I said, \u2018S-s-s it doesn\u2019t matter to \u2019em one bit.

I \nhad lost the thread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about Tom \nRobinson\u2019s wife, and had contented myself with thinking of Finch\u2019s Landing and \nthe river. Aunt Alexandra had got it backwards: the business part of the meeting \nwas blood-curdling, the social hour was dreary.\n\u201cMaudie, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Mrs. Merriweather.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d Miss Maudie said shortly.\nShe said no more.

I could not see Mrs. \nFarrow.\nAunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments, \nneatly engaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. When \nshe had them well on the road with Mrs. Perkins, Aunt Alexandra stepped back. \nShe gave Miss Maudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of \nwomen. Miss Maudie and Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, and \nhere was Aunty silently thanking her for something. For what, I knew not. I was \ncontent to learn that Aunt Alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude \nfor help given. There was no doubt about it, I must soon enter this world, where \non its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.\nBut I was more at home in my father\u2019s world. People like Mr. Heck Tate did not \ntrap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even Jem was not highly \ncritical unless you said something stupid.

The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and \nme; it seemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must \nhave been that neither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their \nchildren must be nice to us in spite of him. The children would never have \nthought that up for themselves: had our classmates been left to their own devices, \nJem and I would have had several swift, satisfying fist-fights apiece and ended the \nmatter for good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our heads high and be, \nrespectively, a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry \nLafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I \nnever understood: in spite of Atticus\u2019s shortcomings as a parent, people were \ncontent to re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, without \nopposition. I came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew \nfrom them, and never thought about them until I was forced to.\nI was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period. \nEach child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents, \nand reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils: \nstanding in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; \ndelivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event \nstrengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to \nreturn to the Group.\nThe idea was profound, but as usual, in Maycomb it didn\u2019t work very well. In the \nfirst place, few rural children had access to newspapers, so the burden of Current \nEvents was borne by the town children, convincing the bus children more deeply \nthat the town children got all the attention anyway. The rural children who could, \nusually brought clippings from what they called The Grit Paper, a publication \nspurious in the eyes of Miss Gates, our teacher. Why she frowned when a child \nrecited from The Grit Paper I never knew, but in some way it was associated with \nliking fiddling, eating syrupy biscuits for lunch, being a holy-roller, singing \nSweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing it dunkey, all of which the state paid \nteachers to discourage.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2431, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "315c5d0c-ace9-4fc6-b516-decc4b322e5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "315c5d0c-ace9-4fc6-b516-decc4b322e5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f200d4f-129a-4ac1-ba16-7f18dfed6153", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/kamal/Documents/chat-open-llama/data/To Kill A Mockingbird.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 503115, "creation_date": "2025-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-13"}, "hash": "993afddfc6c141165dc13b7bc4ae38cdf78b1fbf2ce4ade3815f878e3b041280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Even so, not many of the children knew what a Current Event was.

Ruth Jones, the welfare lady, said Mr. Ewell openly accused \nAtticus of getting his job. She was upset enough to walk down to Atticus\u2019s office \nand tell him about it. Atticus told Miss Ruth not to fret, that if Bob Ewell wanted \nto discuss Atticus\u2019s \u201cgetting\u201d his job, he knew the way to the office.\nThe second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a Sunday-night \nchurchgoer: Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his Sunday night hour alone \nin his big house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the \nwritings of Bob Taylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it). \nOne Sunday night, lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylor\u2019s \nattention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise. \u201cHush,\u201d \nhe said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescript dog.

A shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was \nall he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came home from church to find her husband \nin his chair, lost in the writings of Bob Taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.\nThe third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Tom\u2019s widow. If Mr. Ewell was as \nforgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo Radley. But \nTom was not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas. Mr. Link Deas made a \njob for Helen.

Mrs. Crenshaw, the local seamstress, \nhad as much imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw took some \nchicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham.

His face was as white as his hands, but for a \nshadow on his jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was \nwide; there were shallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray \neyes were so colorless I thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost \nfeathery on top of his head.\nWhen I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on \nthe wall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him, \nas if he heard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension \nslowly drained from his face.

He \ncoughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. \nHis hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He \ncoughed into it, then he wiped his forehead.\nHaving been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been \nsitting beside me all this time, present.
